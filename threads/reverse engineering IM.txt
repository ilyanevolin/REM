this is a seed account for main account:
https://www.pinterest.com/doublju22/

the website they promote has links to amazon products
many pins are taken from fashion sites such as polyvore
^** polyvore does not have affiliate program, but there are alternatives: https://www.quora.com/Does-polyvore-have-an-affiliation-program-for-their-bloggers

they have a polyvore account http://doublju-company.polyvore.com/
this is where most content comes from (to get followers & engagement)
polyvore most recent set was 3 mo ago

once they have that, they can spam their products

their Twitter has only 147 followers (= waste of time ofc  & not updated since 2015)
their FB page not updated since Feb & very low engagement rate
IG page 300 likes per upload, but no uploads since Feb

last pinterest upload was prolly months ago...

overal: business went bad some months ago.
lesson: know your social media platform (twitter is not for ecommerce)

https://www.pinterest.com/julialikelove/
shopify business
8k followers (must have at least 5-10 sales per day) 3% visit rate and 3% conversion rate
note: does not promote website in URL
each pin has a nice amount of repins
description are copy pastes and WTF... seriously need some improv
only source is pinterest

reviews can help your business:

at some point they started promoting lovefad.co instead of http://luxedaze.com/products
those luxedaze products/pins had much lower repin rates
either they had many less followers or the images were crap
looking at the images, the pictures weren't really "buy" mode
once they started promoting new images with better pics (polyvore style), the repins went up drastically
from 7-10 repins to 20-30 and some are even +1k repins

compare quality of images which are getting 300 likes vs those with Â±7 no matter which site they promoted.

before that they were promoting products from http://www.storenvy.com/
probably dropshipping own products from a specific account

before that they promoted https://tepayi.com but repins weren't great
